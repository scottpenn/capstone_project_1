# SpringBoard Capstone Project
### Tennis

This was the first of two capstone projects required for my SpringBoard Data Science curriculum. The goal of this project was to apply the lessons learned in the program to a topic of choice.

For an overview of the project, please look in the "Reports" folder, which contains a slide deck that outlines the project's scope and results.

I plan to update the project's organization and content in the future, to reflect the knowledge I've gained while using data science libraries.
